Y3D for PUSHBUTTON ENGINE
=================

Hello everyone,
This is a little side project to implement Y3D in PBE2.

PBE2 is not officially released yet ( i guess ) but you can still check PBE2 branch at:
https://github.com/PushButtonLabs/PushButtonEngine
This project is forked from it so you don't need to pull it separately

Also you will need latest Yogurt3D which you can find here:
https://github.com/yogurt3d/Yogurt3D
You will need to download this separately and use it as library in your project

Yogurt3D requires Flash 11, keep that in mind...  


Next Steps
----------

I will start covering basic functionality by implementing tutorials in www.yogurt3d.com.tr
